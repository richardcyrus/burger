# Eat-Da-Burger!

The application is deployed on Heroku at the following link: [Eat-Da-Burger!](https://eat-da-burger-rgc.herokuapp.com/) 

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the burger will be displayed on the left side of the page &mdash; waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

This app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Homework Overview

In this assignment, create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Use the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
